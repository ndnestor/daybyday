## About the Project

Day By Day is a life simulation video game developed under the Creation of Games Society at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. The game was inspired by the concern of tedious repetition and isolation experienced by students learning from home during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the game, the player interacts with objects around the room to complete assignments and to determine their character’s direction. The game introduces themes of setting goals, managing free time, and creating a fulfilling lifestyle.
The player is free to interact with objects around the room, including: the piano, the bed, the computer, the tree, the window, the bookshelf, and the yoga mat. These are sites for different tasks and pastimes. How the player chooses to spend their time and manage responsibilities is reflected in the dialogue, environment, and path of the game.
