# Day by Day
## About the Project
![dbd_pic1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69176399/132110604-3711a422-27ca-4cf1-9dfe-91e02527d570.png)
Day By Day is a life simulation video game developed under the Creation of Games Society (https://cogs.club/) at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Our experiences with isolation, monotony, and self-discovery while learning from home during the COVID-19 pandemic were major influences on the game. As the player, your room is full of objects to interact with, including your piano, bed, computer, tree, window, bookshelf, and yoga mat. How you spend your time with them - and the stories they let you get entangled in - is up to you.

*Day by Day is a currently-ongoing project programmed in C# and developed on the Unity platform*
