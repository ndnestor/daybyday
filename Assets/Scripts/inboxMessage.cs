    /*
    For simplicity:
    - Days are denoted as int 1-10 (eg. Day 1 is "1")
    - People are numbered in order of Inbox UI, as follows:

    1: Mom
    2: Grandma Betty
    3: Prof. Turner
    4: Buddy
    5: Brie
    6: Cuz Matt

    dayShown and personShown variables store last shown
    changeDay() and changePerson() if day or person changes, respectively

    Day changes daily, should be implemeneted in Tracking script*
    Person changes when message is selected, implemented through Inbox buttons

    *Some chars use independent day vars (eg. brie uses brieDay) b/c depends on how many
    days you've been talking to them, no necessarily which day it is in-game
    These indepedent variables will simply increment in the changeDay() method
    Those characters are as follows:
    - Brie
    - [add as nec]

    Status changes based on responses, implemented in-game and updated
    through updateStatus() method
    Status is: "isolated", "allResponse", or "noResponse"

    "int" refers to interactiveness, determined on per-character basis for how
    often player has responded to their messages
    0 = isolated
    1 = no response
    2 = all response
    "Status" stores # 0-2 based on which character, outside of newMessage()

    Note to self: implement a script attached to reply buttons to affect statuses of
    convos, such as intBrie for Brie...
